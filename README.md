# Covido Game
Covid-19 is everywhere in 2020. “Covidos” are scattered on your way home so you need to avoid them to stay safe! A Mask can protect you from covidos however you have to throw it away after a while. Search for sanitizers on your way to kill some covidos till you reach home. If you get infected you will be quarantined in you place for a while until the quarantine is over, but beware that your immune
system won't bear a second infection!

Survived? great job, but you are not safe yet! The second wave  strikes again so be careful or you will get infected!
